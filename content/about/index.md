I’m **Nishant Kamal**, a **Site Reliability Engineer** working on large-scale, business-critical SaaS platforms.

At **FarEye**, I focus on ensuring the **reliability, scalability, and performance** of a high-traffic logistics platform used by global enterprises. My day-to-day work involves operating **production Kubernetes clusters**, handling **incidents**, improving **observability**, and building systems that fail safely under load.

I have strong hands-on experience across **Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure, networking, and system observability**, and I regularly work on improving **fault tolerance**, reducing **MTTR**, and enabling teams to ship with confidence.

A major area of my interest is **infrastructure automation and modern delivery practices**. I’ve implemented **GitOps workflows using FluxCD and Helm**, enabling automated, auditable, and consistent deployments across multiple environments. This has helped reduce manual intervention, configuration drift, and deployment risk.

Beyond AWS-based production systems, I’ve also designed **platform engineering POCs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** using **Crossplane**, provisioning and managing cloud resources declaratively via Kubernetes CRDs. This strengthened my understanding of **multi-cloud design** and **infrastructure-as-code at scale**.

Currently, I’m pursuing an **M.Tech in Cloud Computing from BITS Pilani**, where I’m deepening my knowledge of **distributed systems, cloud security, and performance engineering**.

I enjoy working on **hard reliability problems**, collaborating with engineers during incidents, and building systems that are **simple, observable, and resilient by design**.
